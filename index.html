        <h1>No Bs Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: March 13, 2025</em></p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Most privacy policies are designed to bore you into submission. This one isn’t.</p>
        <p>We’ll keep it simple: Synapse: Latency collects some game-related data to improve the experience. No personal details, no invasive tracking - just enough to make sure the world reacts to your choices in meaningful ways.</p>
        <p>By continuing to use Synapse: Latency, you agree to this policy. If that sounds ominous, relax, we’re not selling your data to shady third parties.</p>
        <p>Now, let’s break this down properly.</p>

        <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you interact with the game, we store the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your Choices</strong> – Every decision you make is logged (anonymized) to track global player trends and improve narrative branching.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Player Count</strong> – We track how many active players exist to monitor engagement.</li>
            <li><strong>Notification Settings</strong> – Whether you have notifications enabled, so we know if we should send alerts or let you exist in blissful silence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What We Do Not Collect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your real name, email, or address.</li>
            <li>Your browsing history, private messages, or personal files.</li>
            <li>Any biometric, financial, or legally sensitive data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The goal is to enhance gameplay, not monitor your personal life.</p>

        <h2>3. Where Data is Stored and Who Has Access</h2>
        <p>All data is securely stored and handled through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cloudflare</strong> – Manages security and server protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Anthem Syndicate</strong> – The development team maintaining the game’s backend.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No third-party advertisers, no data reselling, no unauthorized access.</p>

        <h2>4. What We Actually Do With This Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Choice statistics help us understand how players interact with the story.</li>
            <li>Player count allows us to measure engagement and server load.</li>
            <li>Notification settings ensure the system respects your preferences.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That’s it. There’s no behavioral profiling, no targeted ads, and no secret experiments.</p>
        <p>However, if we notice that 98% of players make a logical choice while 2% consistently select the worst possible option, we might laugh at the statistics. We won’t know who made the choice—but we will wonder how civilization has lasted this long.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>If you live in a region with data protection laws, such as the EU (GDPR) or California (CCPA), you have the following rights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access Your Data</strong> – You can request a copy of what we store.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete Your Data</strong> – You can request permanent deletion of your player ID and associated records.</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out of Tracking</strong> – You can disable choice tracking, though this may limit access to global statistics.</li>
            <li><strong>Modify Notification Settings</strong> – You can change whether you receive in-game alerts at any time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To make a request, contact <a href="mailto:definitelyhuman@anthem-syndicate.com">definitelyhuman@anthem-syndicate.com</a> with the subject "Data Request".</p>
        <p>We do not make the process unnecessarily difficult, unlike some platforms that require calling customer service just to delete an account.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Choice statistics are stored indefinitely to power global analytics.</li>
            <li>Your player ID and notification settings can be removed upon request.</li>
            <li>Anything unnecessary is automatically discarded.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not hoard useless data. Unlike certain megacorporations, we don’t see the value in keeping information forever just because we can.</p>

        <h2>7. Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>If we ever change this policy, we will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Announce it via an in-game update log.</li>
            <li>Not bury it in legal jargon or hide it behind obscure links.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you continue using Synapse: Latency after an update, you agree to the revised policy. If that ever becomes an issue, you can always request your data to be removed.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>For questions, data requests, or complaints, contact:</p>
        <p>Email: <a href="mailto:definitelyhuman@anthem-syndicate.com">definitelyhuman@anthem-syndicate.com</a></p>
        <p>We actually read messages, so if you need assistance, reach out.</p>

        <p class="footer">Your data is yours. We're just here to ensure Synapse: Latency remains as immersive as the choices you make.</p>
        <p class="footer">Now get back to it, someones waiting for ya'.</p>
