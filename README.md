# Synapse: Latency - Legal

This repo exists because Google and society insist on things like "privacy" and "user rights."  
You're not supposed to be reading this.  
Just visit the website: [https://privacy.anthem-syndicate.com](https://privacy.anthem-syndicate.com)

There's nothing else interesting here unless you enjoy poking through CSS animations, particle effects, and an unhealthy attention to unnecessary polish.

Carry on.

## Contents

- `index.html` — The "official" Privacy Policy. It looks suspiciously better than it needs to.
- `/css/` — Dark magic styling.
- `/js/` — More animation than strictly necessary for a legal document.
- `/assets/` — Logos and particles pretending this is a serious website.

## License

No license.  
You can't reuse this.  
Don't steal our bad jokes.

## End

That's it.  
Go read the Privacy Policy like the responsible human you are.
