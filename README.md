# Synapse: Latency - Legal

This repository exists because certain institutions demand the existence of a Privacy Policy.

You are not expected to be here.  
You are expected to visit [https://privacy.anthem-syndicate.com](https://privacy.anthem-syndicate.com) like a normal person.

If you are reading this README, you may have noticed that the privacy policy has an uncomfortable amount of styling and animation for something nobody asked for.  
That is not a mistake.  
Please do not question it.

## Contents

- `index.html` — A Privacy Policy. Unnecessarily complicated.
- `/css/` — Styling that serves no functional legal purpose.
- `/js/` — Animations suggesting a questionable allocation of development resources.
- `/assets/` - Visual distractions intended to mask the otherwise grim nature of legal compliance.

## License

None.  
This was built for one purpose and one purpose only.  
You are not permitted to borrow, reuse, or improve it.

## End

There is nothing else here.  
Seriously.  
Go back to pretending you didn’t look.
